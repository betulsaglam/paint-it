A project that is like Paint but simplified, done with Java's GUI libraries.
Simply compile and run PaintBrush.java. You have the option to select colors from the bars on the top and draw rectangles, ovals or draw by hand.
You can also click and move the existing rectangles and ovals to a different place.
